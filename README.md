Word segmentation tests written in Go. 

It is a word-splitting algorithm specifically meant to be applied to the Thai language. The final implementation of this idea is [PyThai](https://github.com/hermanschaaf/pythai), which I chose to write in Python + C.

This is not a finished program in any sense of the word, and is here only for reference or educational purposes. Use it at your own risk. The word frequency list was extracted from the Chula5000 list. You can find the [original Chula5000 list here](http://ling.arts.chula.ac.th/TNC/category.php?id=58&).
